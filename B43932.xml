            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Malicious Endeavours of my Enemies have so poisoned the Minds of some of my Subjects, that by the Reports I have from all Hands, I have Reason to believe, That very many do not think this Son with which God hath blessed Me, to be Mine, but a Supposed Child. But I may say, that by particular Providence, scarce any Prince was ever Born where there were so many Persons present.</p>
               <p>I have taken this time to have the Matter Heard and Examined here, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with the first Eastwardly Wind, will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this Kingdom: And as I have often ventured My Life for the Nation before I came to the Crown, so I think My Self more obliged to do the same, now I am KING; and do intend to go in Person against him, whereby I may be exposed to Accidents, and therefore I thought it necessary to have this now done, in order to satisfie the minds of My Subjects, and to prevent this Kingdom's being engaged in Blood and Confusion after my Death, desiring to do always what may contribute most to the Ease and Quiet of my Subjects, which I have shewed by Securing to them their Liberty of Conscience, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Properties, which I will always preserve.</p>
               <p>I have desired the Queen Dowager to give Her Self the trouble to come hither, to Declare what she knows of the Birth of My Son, and most of the Ladies, Lords, and other Persons who were present, are ready here to Depose upon Oath their Knowledge of this Matter.</p>

                  <p>THat about the 29th of <hi>December</hi> last, the Queen was likely to Miscarry; whereupon she immediatly went unto her, and offered her some effectual Remedies, which are made use of on the like Occasion; which the Queen ordered this Deponent to acquaint the Doctors with.

As soon as the Deponent came in, her Majesty told her, this Deponent, She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved she was in Labour. By this time the Bed was warmed, and the Queen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:211338:5"/>went into Bed, and the King came in. The Queen asked the King, if he had sent for the Queen Dowager; He said he had sent for every Body. The said Deponent stood at the Queens Bolster, the Lady <hi>Rosecomon,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Delabadie,</hi> and the Midwife, on that side of the Bed where the Queen was Delivered. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some lingring Pains, the Queen said, she feared she should not be brought to Bed a good while; but enquiring of the Midwife, she assured her Majesty, that she wanted only one thorow Pain to bring the Child into the World; Upon which the Queen said, It is impossible, the Child lies so high, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this Deponent to lay her Hand on her Majesties Belly, to feel how high the Child lay, which the Deponent did; but soon after a great Pain came on at past Nine of the Clock, and the Queen was Delivered; which the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife by pulling the Deponent by the Coat, assured her was a Son, it being the Sign she told the Deponent she would give her, the Queen having charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her not to let her Majesty know presently, whether it was Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As soon as the Midwife had given the Deponent the Sign, the Deponent made a Sign to to the King that it was a Son. When the Midwife had done her Office, she gave the Child to Mrs. <hi>Delabadie,</hi> which was a Son, and she carried it into the little Bed-Chamber.</p>

After this Deponent having staid a little while, and thinking the Queen in no strong Pain, she, this Deponent, went out, and, being next to the Room where the Queens Linen was a warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heard a noise, and lookt to see what was the matter, and finding no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there, this Deponent ran and found the Lord <hi>Feversham</hi> in the Queens little Bed-Chamber, who told this Deponent the Child was just born; This Deponent ask't him, What is it? His Lordship said he could not tell. So this Deponent ran on to the Queens Beds side, and heard the Queen say to the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, Pray, Mrs. <hi>Wilks,</hi> don't part the Child (which signifies, don't cut the Navel string, until the after-Birth is come away.) And while the Queen was with Child, this Deponent hath heard her Majesty command her Midwife not to do otherwise, it being counted much the safest way; But to what the Queen said just then (to the best of this Deponents Remembrance) Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, Pray Madam give me leave, for I will do nothing, but what will be safe for Your Self and Child; The Queen Answered, Do then, and then cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where is the King gone; His Majesty came immediatly from the other side of the Bed (from just having a sight of the Child) and answered the Queen,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:211338:5"/>Here I am; the Queen said, Why do ye leave me now? The King kneeled on the Bed, on that side where the Deponent stood, and a little after the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife said, All is now come safe away; Upon that the King rose from the Bed, and said, Pray, my Lords, come and see the Child: The king followed Mrs. <hi>Labadie,</hi> and the Lords His Majesty, into the Little Bed-chamber, where this Deponent followed also, and saw as well as they, that it was a Prince, and that Mrs. <hi>Wilks</hi> was in the right to desire to part the Child, for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces face especially his Forehead was blackish, being stunn'd, as I have seen some other Children, when they have been just newly come into the World; but God be thanked, in two hours time that he was drest and washt, (which the Deponent staid by and saw done) the Prince lookt very fresh and well. This Deponent doth further add, That all the while, the Queen was with Child, this Deponent had the honour to pay her Duty very often Mornings and Nights, in waiting upon her Majesty in her dressing Room and Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for the last three or four mouths, this Deponent hath oftentimes seen the Queens Milk, as well as when this Deponent hath had the honor to put on her Majesties Smock.</p>

The Child looked black, whereupon the Deponent desired Doctor <hi>Waldegrave</hi> to look to it, believing it was not well: That the Deponent saw the Navel-string of the Child cut, and three dops of the Blood, which came fresh out, given to him for the Convulsion Fits.</p>

Then passing to the Queen in the next Bed-chamber, the Deponent congratulated the happy Birth of the Prince, and her Majesties safe Delivery. The Queen was wearied and panting, but otherwise in good condition: Then the Midwife brought to the Deponent the <hi>After-Birth</hi> reeking warm, which Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> with the Deponent examined, and found very sound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. After a while, the Deponent understood that a Medicine was mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Ladies for a certain Remedy against Convulsions: It was, some drops of blood from the Navel-string; the Deponent consulted Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> and the other Physitians; and to satisfie the Women, it was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; there being, as was conceived, no danger in the thing. Whereupon, the Midwife, with a small Knife slit the Navel-string beyond the Ligature, from which came some drops of fresh blood, taken in a Spoon, and given the Child, being mix'd with a little <hi>Black Cherry-Water.</hi> Thus much the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hath to say upon Her Majesties present delivery.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Time of the Queens Conception, She often told the Deponent and others, That She had two Reckonings; one, from <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 6th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> when the King return'd from His Progress to the Queen then at <hi>Bathe;</hi> and the other, from <hi>Thursday</hi> the 6th of <hi>October,</hi> when the Queen came to the King at <hi>Windsor;</hi> but for some Reasons the Queen rather reckoned from the latter; though afterward it proved just to agree with the former. Moreover, Her Majesty, when, according to Her Reckoning, She was gone with Child Twelve Weeks, said, That She was quick, and perceived the Child to move; the Deponent returned no Answer to the Queen, but privately told those about Her, That in truth it could not so be in so short a Time, Yet the Queen was in the right only mistook Her Reckoning; for She was then full sixteen Weeks gone with Child; about which time She usually quickned with Her former Children, and accordingly was brought to Bed on the 10th of <hi>June</hi> 1688. and within Three or Four days of full Forty Weeks.</p>

                              <p>UPon <hi>Trinity Sunday,</hi> 10th. <hi>June</hi> 1688. I went to St. <hi>James</hi>'s House about Nine a Clock in the Morning, and followed my Lord Chancellor, through the Lodgings to the Dressing Room, next to the Queens Bed-Chamber, where divers Lords of the Council were met, upon occasion of the Queens being in Labour, the King came several times into the Room, and amongst other things was pleased to tell us, that the Queen came exactly according to her first Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, which was from the Kings Return from his Progress, to <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1687. After this the Counsellors were ordered to come into the Bed-Chamber, and I stood on that side of the Bed, that had the Curtains drawn open, I heard Her Majesty Cry out several times. I staid in the Room during

                              <p>I Had the Honor to be in the King's Chamber in the Morning, when word was brought him, the Queen was not well, and followed him into the Dressing Room next her Majesties Bed-Chamber, where I staid till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty called me to come in, which was about the beginning of her Pains. I confess the Compassion I had for Her Majesty, hearing her Crys, made my stay there very uneasie; One of the last especially seemed to me so sharp, as it really forced me for a little time to stop my Ears with my Fingers to avoid hearing more of the like; when setting them at Liberty, I heard no more, but perceived a sudden satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Faces of the Assistance, several saying, that the Queen was Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and soon thereupon I saw the Prince brought from about the Bed, and carried into the little Bed-Chamber, whither I went afterwards, to behold him more particularly, where I saw him as a Child newly Born.</p>
